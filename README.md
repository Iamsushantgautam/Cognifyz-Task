### 📌 Task 2: Inline Styles, Basic Interaction, and Server-Side Validation

#### 🎯 Objective:
Expand the use of **inline styles** and introduce **server-side validation** for form submissions.

#### 📝 Description:
Building upon Task 1, this task adds more interactive HTML forms and performs validation using **JavaScript** on the client side and **Express** middleware on the server side. It stores validated data in memory to simulate persistence and enhance reliability.

### 📌 Task 4: Complex Form Validation and Dynamic DOM Manipulation

#### 🎯 Objective:
Extend **form validation** and implement **dynamic DOM updates** using JavaScript.

#### 📝 Description:

### 📌 Task 5: API Integration and Front-End Interaction

#### 🎯 Objective:
Introduce **server-client communication** through a **RESTful API**.

#### 📝 Description:
This advanced task walks through creating custom **API endpoints** using Express to support CRUD operations. On the front end, `fetch()` or `axios` is used to call the API and render dynamic data on the web page. It bridges the gap between front-end and back-end interaction effectively.
